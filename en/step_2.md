## Getting Setup

- Go to [dojo.soy/html-b-start](http://dojo.soy/html-b-start). You will see a box containing an example website project. On the right hand side is the website, and on the left hand side is the code that makes the website.
  If you are not signed in, you will need to enter your email address and password to be able to **Remix** the project.

title: Creating a free account on Trinket

You don't have to have an account on Trinket to work with these cards.
However, having one allows you to access your work easily from any computer. It also allows you to save a copy of a project somebody else has shared with you so you can make your own changes to it!

- Go to [dojo.soy/trinket](http://dojo.soy/trinket) and click "Sign Up For Your Free Account" if you do not already have an account. You will need an email address to sign up. 

- Enter your email address and choose a password, or ask somebody to do this for you.

- If you have an account on Trinket, click the "Remix" button at the top right of the project \(if it is not green, you have to sign in and then click it again\). This creates a copy of the project for you to work with. It should say "remixed" after you click it

The main part of the page is broken into two panels. On the left is where you write your code. The different code files appear as tabs. On the right is your website!
